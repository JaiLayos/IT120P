			<p class="faqs-title"><b>Tips for Air Quality Awareness Week</b></p>
		</div>
		<div class="faqs-info">
			<p class="faqs-p-1">The air pollution contributes to the risk for cancer, bronchitis, and other serious health issues in addition to exacerbating preexisting conditions like asthma makes clean air an essential component of public health. According to projections provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), inadequate air pollution is responsible for the preventable deaths of three million people annually across the globe. Acid rain, particulate smog, and other hazardous contaminants are additional effects of air pollution that are detrimental to the environment.</p>
			<p class="faqs-sub"><b>Get the most out of your car by keeping it well-maintained</b></p>
			<p class="faqs-p">A well-maintained vehicle will produce less pollution than an improperly maintained vehicle. Tune-ups improve engine performance and extend the life of emission control systems. Keeping your wheels properly aligned and tires correctly inflated will increase your fuel economy. Also, never fill your petroleum tank to the top at the spigot. This may result in gas leaks and escaping vapors, both of which contribute to air pollution. To reduce your vehicle's emissions, you should never let the engine idle for extended periods. A vehicle that is stationary emits twice as much pollution as one that is in motion. Due to this, experts advise turning off your vehicle when waiting for longer than 10 seconds. Stopping and resuming the engine produces less pollution and saves money on petroleum.</p>
			<p class="faqs-sub"><b>Reduce emissions even more with eco-friendly modes of transportation.</b></p>
			<p class="faqs-p">There are numerous advantages to selecting alternatives to automobiles. Public transportation, bicycling, and walking all provide significant environmental and commuter benefits. In general, these modes of transportation are less expensive and enable you to explore new areas of the metropolis or town as you take different routes. Bicycling and walking provide health advantages while reducing traffic congestion and air pollution. If you have reading or work to complete, consider using public conveyance to avoid having to pay attention to the road. Check with your place of employment or school regarding discounted fares for the local public transportation system.</p>
			<p class="faqs-sub"><b>Recycle and compost to divert waste from landfills.</b></p>
			<p class="faqs-p">Recycling is one of the most effective methods to conserve energy. Many materials, including glass and aluminum, can be repeatedly recycled without degrading. Providing manufacturers with recycled glass and aluminum prevents them from wasting energy on the extraction of natural materials from the earth. Composting is an ancient eco-friendly practice that is gaining popularity once again. By accumulating food remnants and yard waste, you can divert organic material from landfills and create nutrient-rich soil. In the kitchen, coffee grounds, fruit skins, and vegetable leftovers can be collected in a small container. Communal living situations may necessitate a larger collection container; however, be sure to employ lifting apparatus when emptying weighty containers. Composting is essential for reducing air pollution because it facilitates the decomposition of organic waste with the aid of oxygen. These food leftovers decompose anaerobically when they wind up in a landfill. This procedure produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.</p>
			<p class="faqs-sub"><b>Conserve energy to reduce power plant emissions.</b></p>
			<p class="faqs-p-2">Burning fossil fuels in power stations is one of the primary contributors to the problem of air pollution. Making a few easy adjustments around the house can lower the amount of energy you use, which in turn enables power plants to waste less material. </p>
