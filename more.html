			<p class="faqs-sub"><b>What is the air quality forecast for Philippines?</b></p>
			<p class="faqs-p">The Philippines is a Southeast Asian archipelago country. Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao are three distinct regions that make up the more than 7,500 individual islands that make up the Philippines. Manila, the nation's capitol, can be found on the northern coast of the island of Luzon. In 2020, researchers predicted that there would be more than 109 million residents. For Manila in December of 2020, the AQI measured 91, placing it in the "Moderate" category as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). The concentration of PM2.5, the primary pollutant, was 31.2 g/m3.</p>
			<p class="faqs-sub"><b>How bad is the air pollution in Philippines?</b></p>
			<p class="faqs-p">The population of Manila has grown at an alarming rate since 1970, leading to high levels of airborne particles of lead (Pb) and PM2.5 (fine particulate matter). During the COVID 19 pandemic, the Philippine government inadvertently improved the air quality in Metro Manila by following the lead set by other countries in trying to contain the spread of the pandemic. Data showed that the levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decreased by 40% during the first week of the lockdown, much lower than the 20 µg/m³ recorded two weeks earlier. Residents took to social media to share photographs of sunsets over the city using the Sierra Madre as a dramatic backdrop.</p>
			<p class="faqs-sub"><b>What can be done to improve the air quality in Philippines?.</b></p>
			<p class="faqs-p">In Metro Manila, phasing out leaded gasoline, reducing industrial emissions, encouraging recycling, outlawing vehicles older than 15 years, banning bonfires, and investing in an overhead rail system are some of the proposals that can be done to help reduce the bad air. However, residents should not rejoice about the better quality air over the lockdown period, as it increases again as soon as it comes to an end. Air pollution can be caused by human activity, natural disasters, and dust storms.</p>
